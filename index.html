        <p>Hello, my name is Chris, I am attending my second quarter in Programming at Seattle Central. I am most experienced with HTML and JavaScript and eager to get familiar with many more languages and programming concepts.</p>
    
        <p>Besides programming, my interests include music, sports, and old comic books, and my other projects include a record label featuring rock music, and a project to restore pre-war Cambodian music.
